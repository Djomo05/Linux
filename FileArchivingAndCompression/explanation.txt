1. Tarballs are containers to store files in for compression
2. Tarballs can be compressed using various compression algoritms.
3. gzip and bzip2 are common options on Linux. xz is another option.
4. You can also use the zip and unzip commands to create/extract .zip files.
5. Saw how to do archiving and compression in one step.

When you're compressing and archiving files in Linux, The first thing you need to know about is
something called 
a tarball. Now, I want you to imagine that you're at a shopping center or to your local store and you're 
buying some apples, okay? Now let me ask you a question. How would you make those apples after picking 
them up easier to carry? well you'd put them in a bag, right? And that's what creating a tarball is basically 
doing. Okay, so creating a tarball is basically a way of putting your files in a bag to make them easier to
compress and make them easier to store, okay? And when you add files to a tarball, you make it possible to
store all of your files in one place. And the tarball itself doesn't do any compression. But tarballs can be
compressed using compression algorighms, okay?

# To create our tarball we can do this
===> Run "tar -cvf ourarchive.tar file[1-3]" this will create it and putt our 3 files in it.

# To test our tarball we can simple do
===> Run "tar -tf ourarchive.tar" this show the content in our tarball file

# To extract our tarball file we can simple do 
===> Run "tar -xvf ourarchive.tar" this will extract our archive file


# The main compression algorithm in Linux is "gzip and bzip2" 

# gzip: is faster but has less compression power.
# bzip2: on the other hand, can generally compress files to a smaller size than gzip but does requires
# more computational time.

#######################################
# Compression is a two stage thing,
# First we make a tarball and then we compress that tarball
# With a compression algorithm ( gzip or bzip2 )
######################################

# After generating our tarball file we can then use the "gzip" command to compress that file
===> Run "gzip ourarchive.tar"

# To reverse the "gzip" to get our tarball file back we can do:
===> Run "gunzip ourarchive.tar.gz"

# To compress our tarball file using the bzip2 command we can do:
===> Run "bzip2 ourarchive.targ"

# To unzip our bzip2 compress file we can simply do:
===> Run "bunzip2 ourarchive.tar"

# We can also have the "xz" algorithm compression

# To zip our file we can also use the "zip" command
===> Run "zip ourzip.zip file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt"

# To unzip a file zip with a zip command we can do:
===> Run "unzip ourzip.zip"


# To put file in a tarball and compress it we can use a tar command like this:
===> Run "tar -cvzf ourarchive.tar.gz file[1-3].txt" this will directly put all the file in a tarball
then, zip with with the gzip algorithm because we've used the z option on the tar command"

# To compress with the bzip2 command we can do:
===> Run "tar -cvjf ourarchive.tar.bz2 file[1-3].txt"


# To extract file compressed with a "gzip" algorithm
===> Run "tar -xvzf ourarchive.tar.gz"

# To extract a file compressed with a "bzip2" algorithm
===> Run "tar -xvjf ourarchive.tar.bz2"
